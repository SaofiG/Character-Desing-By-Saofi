        <p>I'm a fanatic of fictional stories, y love to read and watch all kinds of tales, 
            around my favorites are the movies from the MCU and the DC series, also animated 
            series like “Trollhunters: Tales of Arcadia”, “Carmen Sandiego” and “The Dragon Prince”; 
            among all the fictional stories you can find, the ones with the most interesting character 
            designs usually are anime shows, some like “My Hero Academia”, “Demon Slayer”, and “Naruto”.</p>

        <p>Most of the characters on animated series are used to have only one or maybe two outfits, 
            that's typically a resource used by the creators to save money on designs, it also can make 
            easier the job of the animators, still, some characters appear with new designs every episode, 
            a couple of examples would be Star Butterfly, from “Star vs The Forces of Evil” and Connie, from 
            “Steven Universe”.<br>
            <br>

            <br>
            With characters that only have one outfit, a change in their physical appearance can be related 
            to their development in the story, like a change in their personality or point of view of their 
            world, an example of these would be Isabella Madrigal, from the recent Disney film “Encanto”; a 
            change on the character's clothing can also be a one-episode thing, for a good example we can 
            talk about “Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Chat Noir”, on this show, there have been episodes 
            where the characters wear new outfits or accessories for specific situations.<br>

            The changes can also be attributed to time, after time in the story's universe passes and the 
            characters grow up it is possible that they can receive changes in their clothes, look or even 
            personalities, some examples are:

               <li class="list">Sasuke Uchiha, from the “Naruto” series, who between “Naruto” and “Naruto Shippuden”

            <h2>Relatable character</h2>

            <p>The character's physical appearance is what usually calls the audience's attention, still, 
            their personalities is what makes them more likable or interesting; a character with a sweet 
            and kind personality is expected to have more attention from the public, but this ain't always 
            the case, people are more likely to prefer the "mean" characters, or those that are kinda sassy
             or funny.
            </p>

            <p>A character does not only has to be striking, but it also needs to have <em>good</em> development to 
                be a <em>good</em> character, it has to be relatable for the viewer, the characters may be fictional, 
                still, these can go through the same stuff real people do, the more realistic a character 
                is the more relatable it becomes, and it could even turn into a community's comfort character, 
                let's talk about a few pretty interesting characters:

                    alt="Dipper Pines trans flag" width="300"> Mason "Dipper" Pines, from "Gravity Falls", a young boy who lives a crazy summer 
                    with his grunkle Stan, his twin sister Mabel and some other friends the twins made 
                    during the story; Dipper is a 12-13 year old boy with self-confidence issues, like 
                    a lot kids are at that age; he's started being insecure about his masculinity, strength, 
                    the way he looked and some other things not many people give importance, like his 
                    birthmark or his name; during the show, Dipper grows more confident, overcoming his 
                    insecurities and fears, after having to save his friends, family, and even the whole 
                    town from all kinds of weird crautures, after all the adventures, he never stopped 
                    being that smart little guy from the beginning.<br>
                    <br>
                    Dipper is also a big source of theories for the fandom, well based on his attitude and 
                    some other hints that can be found on the show and the official book, the fans have 
                    theorized that Dipper may be a transgender boy, and for some people from the trans 
                    community Dipper has become a comfort character that they can relate to.

                    alt="Mabel Pines" width="300"> Mabel Pines is Dipper's older twin sister, she's a very 
                    hyperactive child, who's always messing around and having fun, she always seems to be 
                    happy, and she's got a smile on her face most of the time, almost the opposite of her 
                    brother whose pretty serious most of the time, because of these differences, the twins 
                    are used to have fights, well Mabel's childish behavior makes her seem immature, but 
                    the reality behind her behavior, is fear, fear of growing up and having to leave a lot 
                    behind, Mabel is scared that growing up could mean getting apart from her friends and 
                    family, during the last episodes of the show, everything goes crazy, Bill, the villain, 
                    has apparently won the battle, Mabel and Dipper are speared, Dipper wanted to stay in 
                    Gravity Falls and study with his grunkle Ford, but Mabel wasn't okay with that, they 
                    got into a fight and Bill used that to trick Mabel, causing the “weirdomagedon” and 
                    trapping Mabel inside some kind of magic bubble prison where she could be “happy”, 
                    everything inside the bubble was created based on Mabel's fantasies, all joy, wonder 
                    and cats, she was the ruler of that “magical place” where she could have everything 
                    she wanted, even a “cooler” version of her brother, still, none of it was real, and 
                    Mabel accepted it at the end, she had to overcome her fears to be able to help her 
                    friends to save the town, at the end the twins had learned that the most important 
                    thing was being together to support each other, and they come back home expecting the 
                    next summer.<br><br>

                    alt="Dipper and Pacifica" width="250">Just as Mabel, a lot of pre-teens have been trough a lot of pressure from their families 
                    and society, well adults always seem to expect them to be mature, there always seems to 
                    be that teenagers are expected to act like adults while being treated like kids, Mabel 
                    tries to ignore the expectations and live her life with all fun and games, so she won't 
                    feel like she's loosing her childhood, and that's what many kids do to handle the 
                    pressure, others are more likely to opt for another option, obedience, like Pacifica 
                    Northwest, another character from the show, a girl from a rich family that wasn't allowed 
                    to act like a child, she couldn't wear what she wanted, she couldn't choose who to be 
                    friends with, she had to be “perfect”, she was so terrified of her parents punishments 
                    that with just ringing a bell they had total control over her, as if she were a trained 
                    dog, these change when the Pines twins become her friends, and Pacifica finally takes 
                    a decision of her own, doing the right thing, even though her parents got mad, her new 
                    friends were proud of her, and so was herself.
